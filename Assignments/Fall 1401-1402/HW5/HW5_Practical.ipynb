    "\n",
    "Imagine that you have gone to the doctor's because you feel ill.\n",
    "The doctor is equipped with lots of theoretical knowledge about different kinds of illness. She/He also has access to a wide variety of powerful medical tools invented to help ill people, like chemical solutions and tablets. But before using these tools, it is necessary to perform a **diagnosis** step first. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar statements are true when talking about statistical inference. Over the years, many powerful probabilistic techniques have been developed to help gain useful information from data. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis testing** provides a systematic process in which one can check if there is a 'meaningful' distinction between two groups of observations, each having a certain property. You can, for example, test if male employees are paid higher amounts on average than female employees in a country, using a relatively small sample of male and female employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Regression** methods are designed to find linear relations between *variables*, which are properties of collected datapoints. Using these methods, you can build a *model* that takes the collected data and estimates the desired property of a new data point. Estimating the price of a car given its technical features could be one usual application of such methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list continues even more. But the important point to keep in mind here is that none of these *automated* techniques can give you a deep and complete understanding of the data on their own. In fact, some prior insight into data is *required* to be able to use such systematic procedures appropriately. As the doctor needs diagnosis to select the appropriate medical care - say, a drug - and select the appropriate way of using it - say, its dose - we need to examine our data before using *automated* techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is when 'Exploratory Data Analysis' comes in. Loosely speaking, EDA is the process of 'diagnosing' the dataset. You first try to gain some insight into data before further analyses. This can be useful in many ways. \n",
    "- Unexpected discoveries about data, which can lead to further studies\n",
    "- Suggesting appropriate hypotheses to test\n",
    "- Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques\n",
    "- Being more familiar with data and so getting able to analyze it both intuitively and systematically\n",
    "\n",
    "## So, How to Perform EDA?\n",
    "As mentioned before, EDA is the process of 'diagnosing' and getting insight into data. So it is more than anything, a state of mind and does not have any strict 'set of rules'. Although there are guidelines about which EDA techniques are useful in what circumstances, there is an important degree of looseness and art to EDA. Competence and confidence come with practice, experience, and close observation of others. Also, EDA need not be restricted to techniques you have seen before; **sometimes you need to invent a new way of looking at your data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having this said, there are some 'conventions' in EDA:\n",
    "- Take visualization seriously! People are not very good at looking at a column of numbers or a whole spreadsheet and then determining important characteristics of the data. They find looking at numbers to be tedious, boring, and/or overwhelming. Exploratory data analysis techniques have been devised as an aid in this situation. \n",
    "- Be eagle-eyed! Pay attention to what you are seeing. Does the data meet your expectations? Are there any anomalies? What are the most common values of variables, and why? During EDA you should be careful and ask intelligent questions about data.  You:\n",
    "\t1. Generate questions about your data.\n",
    "\t2. Search for answers by visualizing, transforming, and modeling your data.\n",
    "\t3. Use what you learn to refine your questions and/or generate new questions\n",
    "- Tip: EDA usually starts with considering the distribution of variables, and correlations between them. Paying attention to the form of distributions is important. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, no technology can replace that precise, rational thinking of humans that reveals the hidden aspects of mysterious problems! To be a data scientist is similar to being a detective. They both pay attention to the smallest details, put the clues in order, and try to see the underlying reasons for each property. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example\n",
    "Findings from EDA are orthogonal to the primary analysis task. To illustrate, consider an example from Cook et al. where the analysis task is to find the variables which best predict the tip that a dining party will give to the waiter. [Here is the original source of this example.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis#cite_note-12) The variables available in the data collected for this task are: the tip amount, total bill, payer gender, smoking/non-smoking section, time of day, day of the week, and size of the party. The primary analysis task is approached by fitting a regression model where the tip rate is the response variable. The fitted model is\n",
    "\n",
    "(tip rate) = 0.18 - 0.01 × (party size)\n",
    "which says that as the size of the dining party increases by one person (leading to a higher bill), the tip rate will decrease by 1%, on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, exploring the data reveals other interesting features not described by this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "    <img src=\"pics/hist1.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Histogram of tip amounts where the bins cover $1 increments. The distribution of values is skewed right and uni-modal (= having one mode), as is common in distributions of small, non-negative quantities.\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Histogram of tip amounts where the bins cover $0.10 increments. An interesting phenomenon is visible: peaks occur at the whole-dollar and half-dollar amounts, which is caused by customers picking round numbers as tips. This behavior is common to other types of purchases too, like gasoline.\n",

We might expect to see a tight, positive linear association, but instead, see a variation that increases with tip amount. In particular, there are more points far away from the line in the lower right than in the upper left, indicating that more customers are very cheap than very generous.\n",

Males tend to pay the (few) higher bills, and the female non-smokers tend to be very consistent tippers (with three conspicuous exceptions shown in the sample).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is learned from the plots is different from what is illustrated by the regression model, even though the experiment was not designed to investigate any of these other trends. The patterns found by exploring the data suggest hypotheses about tipping that may not have been anticipated in advance, and which could lead to interesting follow-up experiments where the hypotheses are formally stated and tested by collecting new data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's Start!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have been introduced to the concept of EDA, it's time for trying it in practice. In this assignment, two questions have been designed. In the first one, we want to practice the skills needed for a good EDA. For doing so, we complete an EDA process step by step. This is like performing pre-defined tasks instead of doing free research - which is less appealing but is more beneficial at the start. We use the 'penguins.csv' dataset in this question, which is a very appropriate one for practicing EDA. This dataset contains information about more than 300 penguins that live in the Palmer Archipelago, located northeast of Antarctica. This information is real and potentially contains lots of knowledge about these penguins. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second question, you pick a favorite dataset and do EDA on it, without limitations!\n",
    "\n",
    "When doing this exercise, you may find some questions a bit ambiguous or vague. You may not also be confident about the correctness of your answers. Don't panic! There is no 'right answer' in this exercise. The important thing to us is your analyzing abilities and your advancements in *diagnosing* the data. For example, when we require you to predict the correlation between two random variables, we are **, not** interested to check if your prediction was correct or not. Rather, we are really interested to check if you've performed meaningful reasoning and analysis after seeing that your prediction was correct - or incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is highly recommended to use some appropriate environment - like RStudio - to write your code and consider your plots, rather than the browser you're reading this text on. \n",
